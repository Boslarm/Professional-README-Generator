# Professional README Generator

## Description
The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate my understanding and implimentation of node.js That is creating a space on a local machine to write/create applications that can be run and tested without using an off-sight server. We used the built-in "File System" npm through node, as well as a third-party npm for allowing user input, "Inquirer". All coding was done in .js files and written into a .md file after input has been taken. Look at "Sample_README.md" for a sample of a readme file created with the generator.
